• 50% is actual code and balance 50% of the size is on account of "others" (1032192 bytes) which is a __LINKEDIT segment.
• LINKEDIT segment contains the information necessary to relocate the binary by dynamic loader.
• Some resources on LINKEDIT section:

• from 1032192 bytes (~1mb) 
• to 500256 bytes (0.4mb)
• With DEPLOYMENT_POSTPROCESSING=YES and ENABLE_BITCODE=NO build setting, the size of the LINKEDIT section came down 
• Overall dunamis-ingest library size is 1.2mb
• But the catch is the consuming application must also have ENABLE_BITCODE=NO to consume the library.
