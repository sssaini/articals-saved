	function :

	// unit test
	The BUILD-OPERATE-CHECK2 pattern is made obvious by the structure of these tests. Each of the tests is clearly split into three parts. The first part builds up the test data, the second part operates on that test data, and the third part checks that the operation yielded the expected results.

	//concurrency
  “Objects are abstractions of processing. Threads are abstractions of schedule.”
