Simple Past or Past Perfect?
The simple past and the past perfect, also past perfect simple, both express completed actions that took place in the past. We use the simple past to say what happened in the past, often in sequential order. The past perfect expresses events and actions that occurred prior to another past action (usually expressed in the simple past). In spoken English, it is common to use only the simple past and not the past perfect.

The simple past and the present perfect are often confused by non-native speakers, but they are not interchangeable in English grammar. The simple past expresses completed past actions and often includes a reference to time. The present perfect is used to talk about actions which began in the past but aren’t yet complete or actions from the recent past when no reference to time is made.
