Good questions to test your knowledge:

• Isn’t LB another SPOF? how can we provide a failover for LB?
• Isn’t my OS limited by 64K ports? is linux capable of doing that out of the box?
• How does mongo solves failover and high scalability? how about cassandra? how cassandra does sharding when a new node come to the cluster?
• What is cache lock? What caching policies should I use?
• How can a single domain have multiple IP addresses (ex: $ host www.google.com)? What is BGP? How can we use DNS or BGP to serve geographically users?
