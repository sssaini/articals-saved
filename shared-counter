• The solution is to shard counters. This means:
• Create N counters in parallel.
• Pick a shard to increment transactionally at random for each item counted.
• To get the real current count sum up all the sharded counters.
• Contention is reduced by 1/N. Writes have been optimized because they have been spread over the different shards. A bottleneck around shared state has been removed.
