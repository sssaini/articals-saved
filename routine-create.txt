• Introduce an intermediate, understandable abstraction
• Avoid duplicate code
• Support subclassing
• Hide sequences
• Hide pointer operations
• Improve portability
• Simplify complicated boolean tests
• Improve performance
In addition, many of the reasons to create a class are also good reasons to create a routine:
