Why use MapReduce?
- Nice way to partition tasks across lots of machines.
- Handle machine failure.
- Works across different application types, like search and ads. Almost every application has map reduce type operations. You can precompute useful data, find word counts, sort TBs of data, etc.
- Computation can automatically move closer to the IO source.
